        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p id = "aboutMe"> With a start in the electrical field, I discovered my true calling in the realm of technology. Growing up, I had a natural affinity for computers, which led me to build and tinker with them. Seeking to turn my passion into a career, I enrolled in True Coders to become a C# programmer. Today, I am proud to have gained expertise in designing, developing, analyzing, and implementing client-server, web, and desktop applications using C#. My attention to detail and drive for success have made me a dependable and professional programmer. Additionally, I have experience in computer building and windows and OS installations. I am dedicated to continuously expanding my skills and knowledge in the ever-evolving technology industry.
