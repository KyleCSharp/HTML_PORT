        <h1>ABOUT ME</h1>
        <p id = "aboutMe"> My career path started as an electrician in 2019 going through an apprenticeship program. I quickly realized that was not the career path for me. I love computers and always have. Even when I was young, I was the computer guru everywhere I went. I have built a couple of computers here and there and I wanted to learn more on the software side and make a career out of it so i joined True coders. Here I am today making my first website and I couldn't be more proud of myself, not just because the career options are endless in something that I enjoy doing, but proud of the knowledge I have gained. I am now a self-driven, detail-oriented, and professional C# programmer with experience in designing, developing, analyzing, and implementing client-server, web, and desktop-based applications using C# language. Computer builder and designer, experienced in windows and OS installation.
